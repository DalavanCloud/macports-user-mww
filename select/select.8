.It Va __PREFIX__/etc/select/__NAME__/base
Base configuration for the software __NAME__. Each line in the file specifies a file that __NAME___select provides by symlinking it to a target file. Paths will all be prefixed by the prefix provided at install time (__PREFIX__ in this case).
.br
.Sy Example:
.Dl bin/foo
.Dl sbin/bar
.Dl share/man/man1/foo.1.gz
.br
.It Va __PREFIX__/etc/select/__NAME__/${version}
Configuration for a specific version of the software __NAME__. This provides one possibility to choose from. When this version is selected, all files from the base configuration get symlinked to the corresponding files in the version file. Each line in the base configuration file corresponds to the same line in the version file. If the version cannot provide a target file, the line in the version file has to start with a '-' (The symlink will then be deleted if this version is activated). Lines may start with a '/' for absolut an absolut path. If lines do not start with a '/', they will be prefixed by __PREFIX__.

.Dl bin/foo-5.9
